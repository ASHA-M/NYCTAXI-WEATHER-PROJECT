# Do weather conditions influence yellow taxi tips in New York City (2021)?  

## Purpose of the Project

To investigate if drivers get a higher tip percentage under certain weather conditions.  
To investigate the relationship between hour of day and tip percentage. 
To build a model to see if weather conditions along with selected features that are readily available to the cab driver had an effect on if drivers got a tip or not (Model 1).   
To build a model to see if weather conditions along with selected features that are readily available to the cab driver had an effect on drivers getting tips over 15% (Model 2).  
To build a model where all weather features are elimated and compare against other models (Model 3).  

## Key insights and conclusions
A higher pecentage of tips were received during cloudy and clear weather conditions.  
Temperatures over 24Â°C showed rapidly declining tips.  
Model 1 had a 77% Precision (everytime it predicts that the driver will get a tip, there is a 77% chance the driver will actually the tip).  
Model 2 had a 96% Recall for tips over 15% (out of all the drivers that have got more than 15% tips the model could correctly identify 96% of them).    
Model 3 scores were almost the same as Model 2.  
Feature importance showed that hour of day is the most important feature not weather conditions.   

## Data Limitations
Covid-19 greatly impacted the percentage of tips received in 2021
